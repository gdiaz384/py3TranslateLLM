# Options can be specified here or by using the command line interface (CLI) at the command prompt/terminal.
# Settings specified at the CLI override these values.
# A hash tag # at the start of a line means the line is a comment.
# The keys in the key=value pairs are case sensitive.
# 'None' means 'leave as the default value' or 'do not specify this value.'
# Some options are required, so setting them to None and also not specifying them in the CLI will result in an error.
# For valid encodings, please always and only use utf-8. Alternatively, refer to this list: TODO put link here.

# Important:
# Using relative paths like 'mypath\myFile.xlsx' is just asking for trouble because they resolve relative to the location of wherever the command prompt happens to be at the time.
# Use absolute paths if at all possible like: C:\Users\User\Downloads\myGame\scenario\scene1.xlsx
# Backslash \ or forwardslash / for paths does not matter. Both work.

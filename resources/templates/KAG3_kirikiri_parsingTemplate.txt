# This file establishes the definitions for the built in parser and file writer to use with KAG3 kirkikri game engine scripts (.ks).
# Lines starting with # are comments.
# The key names in key=value are case sensitive.

# If a line begins with one of the following characters, then do not process it for dialogue. Separate each character with a space.
# Groups of characters are not currently supported. Set to 'None' (without quotes) to parse every line. This setting is to help isolate
# lines of dialogue. Names have special handling later, so include their delimiters here. Like with: 【Chloe】, include 【.
#ignoreLinesThatStartWith=None
ignoreLinesThatStartWith=[ * ; 【 ・

# When do paragraphs end? Valid options are to have paragraphs end on: 'emptyLine', or 'newLine'. Input will stop automatically
# regardless of this setting when maximumNumberOfLinesPerParagraph is reached or if an ignoreLinesThatStartWith character.
# is reached. Setting paragraphDelimiter=newLine will force a 1:1 relationship between input and pre-wordwrap output lines.
#paragraphDelimiter=newLine
paragraphDelimiter=emptyLine

# What is the maximum number of lines per paragraph? A sane setting for this is 2-5 lines maximum per paragraph. 
# Look at the script.ks file to see how text is laid out. This setting is ignored if paragraphDelimiter=newLine.
#maximumNumberOfLinesPerParagraph=1
maximumNumberOfLinesPerParagraph=3

# What is the maximum length for translated text before triggering word wrap? The correct setting for this depends on
# the font used, which can sometimes be changed by the user at runtime, and the target language. Sane values are 30-60.
# This setting strongly influences the number of calculated output lines and is only used when writting back to the original file.
wordWrap=45

# The number of untranslated input lines will not always match the number of translated output lines, especially with
# different wordWrap amounts. How should this situation be handled? Valid values are: 'disableWordWrap', 'strict', 'dynamic'.
    # 'disableWordWrap'=Disable word wrapping and always dump all translated text onto one line. 
        #Replace subsequent untranslated lines with empty lines.
    # 'strict'=If the number of input lines and translated lines match exactly, then replace as normal. Otherwise, do nothing.
        # The lines with a mismatch will be placed into 'mismatch.xlsx', and it is the user's responsibility to sort through those lines.
    # 'dynamic'=If there are fewer lines after translation, replace the extra untranslated lines with empty lines.
        # If there are more lines after translation, then append the extra lines to the last untranslated line.
wordWrapMode=dynamic

# Do character names appear before, after, or within dialogue? Valid values are, 'None', 'before', 'after', 'within'.
# 'None' means disable all special processing related to character names and submit the text for translation as-is.
# 'before' and 'after' imply that character names appear on a different line with associated delimiters. Example:
# 【Chloe】[audio Chloe_1B]
# 「For Queen and country.」
# In the above two lines, 【 and  】 are acting as delimiters, so 'before' is the correct setting.
# 'within' is for character names that appear completely alone 'on top' of dialogue and without special delimiters.
# Use 'within' if the character name is on its own line. Example:
# Chloe
# 「For Queen and country.」
#characterNamesAppearBeforeOrAfterDialogue=None
characterNamesAppearBeforeOrAfterDialogue=before

# If 'within' was specified above, then valid character names must be specified to differentiate them from lines of dialogue.
# Separate character names with commas , Character names are case sensitive.
characterNameIsWithinValidOptions=Chloe, Israel, Orlando

# If the character name is not part of the main text, then how should it be detected? Valid values are 'None', a single character, or
# a group of characters. Grouped characters will be treated as a single entity. Both BeginsWith and EndsWith must match
# exactly for a character name to be detected. The character name must be within two lines of the associated dialogue line.
# If theCharacterNameAlwaysBeginsWith is set to None, then all text before theCharacterNameAlwaysEndsWith is the character name.
# If theCharacterNameAlwaysEndsWith is set to None, then all text after theCharacterNameAlwaysBeginsWith is the character name.

# By default, [codes] inside of square brackets are not sent to the translation engine, even if they are present in paragraphs,
# but are moved to the end of the post-translated text when writing back to the original file.
# Important: Setting *any* of these settings to a value different than 'None' will disable reinsertion of [codes] after translation.
# The following alterations will honor the word wrap setting above for the base text on the line only.
